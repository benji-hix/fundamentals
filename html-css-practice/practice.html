            <p>Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, enwrought with golden and silver light,
                The blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half light,
                I would spread the cloths under your feet:
            </p>
            <p>But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; tread softly
                because you tread on my dreams.
            </p>
